## üìù Description
This is a bonus project that is a redesign of my first project for General Assembly.  It takes my first game of Battleship and converts it into a an Express app using a TypeScript server.  Users can now sign in and play the game of Battleship.  The game will increment a score, wins, losses, and games played for each user.  There is now a Leaderbord page to display all users' scores.  The user with the highest score will be at the top.  For more information regarding the first project, see this <a href="https://github.com/nickldimartino/Battleship-Game">GitHub repo</a>.
